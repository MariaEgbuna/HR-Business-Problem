## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis

## 1. Employee Retention & Attrition Analysis

### Turnover Rate by Job Title

| Job Title | Employee Count | Exited Employees | Turnover Rate |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Data Architect | 1 | 1 | 100% |
| Enterprise Architect | 5 | 4 | 80% |
| Software Engineering Manager | 10 | 7 | 70% |
| Sr. BI Developer | 10 | 6 | 60% |
| BI Developer | 9 | 5 | 55.6% |
| Data Analyst | 23 | 12 | 52.2% |
| Senior Software Engineer | 23 | 11 | 47.8% |
| Principal Software Engineer | 10 | 4 | 40% |
| Network Engineer | 12 | 4 | 33.3% |
| Front End Developer | 3 | 1 | 33.3% |

**Observations:**

- **Highly Specialized and Management Roles:** Job titles like `Data Architect`, `Enterprise Architect`, and `Software Engineering Manager` exhibit exceptionally high turnover rates, indicating significant challenges in retaining talent in these critical areas.
- **Data/BI Roles:** `Sr. BI Developer`, `BI Developer`, and `Data Analyst` also show substantial turnover, suggesting a potential industry-wide or company-specific issue in retaining data professionals.
- **Variability:** While some roles have very high turnover, others like `Senior Software Engineer` and `Principal Software Engineer` show high but comparatively lower rates.

### Turnover Rate by Pay Zone

| Payzone | Employee Count | Exited Employees | Turnover Rate |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Zone C | 1206 | 647 | 53.6% |
| Zone A | 1373 | 704 | 51.3% |
| Zone B | 477 | 237 | 49.7% |

**Observations:**

- **Consistent High Turnover:** All three pay zones (`Zone C`, `Zone A`, `Zone B`) exhibit very similar and high turnover rates, ranging from approximately 49.7% to 53.6%. This indicates that high turnover is not concentrated in one specific compensation tier but is a broader organizational issue.

### Supervisor Assignment & Turnover

**Observations:**

- While some supervisors showed 100% turnover, this was predominantly in cases where they managed only one employee. Therefore, a clear, pervasive pattern of supervisor assignments *directly causing* high turnover could not be definitively established from this dataset due to the small team sizes under such supervisors.

## 2. Tenure & Performance Insights

### Relationship between Tenure and Termination Type

| Termination Type | Avg Tenure (Yrs) |
|:---|:---|
| PIP | 1.60 |
| Resignation | 1.49 |
| Involuntary | 1.34 |
| Retirement | 1.31 |
| Voluntary | 1.26 |
| Unknown | 1.26 |

**Observations:**

- **Overall Short Tenure:** The average tenure across all termination types is remarkably short, generally ranging from 1.2 to 1.6 years. This indicates a pervasive challenge in retaining employees for longer durations, regardless of how they leave the company.
- **Unexpected PIP Tenure:** Surprisingly, employees terminated due to a **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)** have the *longest average tenure* (approximately 1.60 years). This is a counter-intuitive finding that might suggest a prolonged process for managing and exiting underperforming employees.
- **Resignations:** Employees who `Resign` have the second-longest average tenure, slightly less than those on PIP.

### Impact of Employee Classification on Performance Ratings

| Employee Classification | Avg Performance Score |
|:---|:---|
| Full-Time | 3.02 |
| Temporary | 3.01 |
| Part-Time | 3.00 |

**Observations:**

- **Minimal Impact:** The `Employee Classification` (Full-Time, Temporary, Part-Time) has a very minimal impact on `Avg Performance Score`. All classifications show an average performance score very close to 3.0 ('Fully Meets'), suggesting a consistent level of performance or a consistent rating distribution across different employee types.

### Relationship between Performance Scores and Tenure

**Observations:**

- The relationship between `performance_score` and `tenure` is not straightforward. While 'Exceeds' performers generally have good tenure, the **longest tenure was observed among 'PIP' employees**. This warrants further investigation into the specific circumstances surrounding employee tenure under performance improvement plans.

### Percentage of Low-Performing Employees by Business Unit

| Business Unit | Employee Count | No of Low Performers | Percentage |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| PYZ | 299 | 36 | 12.04% |
| BPC | 303 | 32 | 10.56% |
| MSC | 296 | 31 | 10.47% |
| CCDR | 300 | 27 | 9.00% |
| PL | 301 | 26 | 8.64%|
| SVG | 304 | 25 | 8.22% |
| WBL | 294 | 24 | 8.16% |
| TNS | 297 | 23 | 7.74% |
| EW | 302 | 23 | 7.62%|
| NEL | 304 | 23 | 7.57% |

**Observations:**

- **PYZ has the highest percentage:** The 'PYZ' business unit stands out with 12.04% of its employees classified as low-performing ('Needs Improvement' or 'PIP').
- **Other significant units:** 'BPC' and 'MSC' also show relatively high percentages of low-performing employees at around 10.5% and 10.47% respectively.
- **Varying percentages:** The percentages across the top 10 business units range from about 7.5% to over 12%. This indicates a clear disparity in the concentration of low performers across different units, suggesting a need for targeted interventions.

| Departments | Employee Count | Exited Enployees | Attrition Rate |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Executive Office | 24 | 19 | 79.2%|
| Admin Offices | 80 | 48 | 60.0% |
| Software Engineering | 115 | 64 | 55.7% |

| Production | 2020 | 1014 | 50.2% |
| Sales | 331 | 164 | 49.5% |

**Observations:**

- **Executive Office has the highest attrition:** The 'Executive Office' department stands out significantly with an attrition rate of approximately 79.17%. While it has a smaller total number of employees, this rate is exceptionally high.
- **Admin Offices and Software Engineering also high:** 'Admin Offices' and 'Software Engineering' follow with notably high attrition rates of 60% and 55.65%, respectively.
- **Widespread Attrition:** Even larger departments like 'IT/IS', 'Production', and 'Sales' show attrition rates around or above 50%, indicating that high attrition is a prevalent issue across most departments.
